title: "leader-based consensus algorithm"
---

A **leader-based algorithm** is a type of [distributed system](/notes/distributed-system/) protocol where **one designated node** (called the **leader** or **primary**) is responsible for coordinating all changes, managing the flow of requests, and ensuring consistency across the entire cluster of nodes.

The primary role of a leader-based design is to simplify the complex problem of reaching consensus and managing a consistent state among many independent servers.
