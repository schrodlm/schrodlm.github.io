title: "Mac Address"
---

MAC is essentially just a unique string that works as a identifier of device provide for its network card during manufacturing proccess. MAC address consists of **48 bits**.
And most of the time it is expressed as six hexadecimal numbers seperated by ":".

**Example**: 01:23:45:67:89:ab

MAC (medium access controll address) were introduced to provide a **unique identifier** for each [network interface card](/notes/network-interface-card/) (NIC) on a network. MAC address is provided for each NIC during the manufacturing process. Its uniqueness is essential for several reasons:
1. **Device identification**
	Each device on a network needs a way to distinguish itself from others. MAC addresses serve as a **hardware-based** identifier, ensuring that two devices on the same network cannot have the same address.

2. **Addressing**
	MAC addresses are used as the destination address in network packets. 
	- this allows devices to send data directly to specific recipients without relying on higher-level addressing schemes like IP addresses. This is used by [switches](/notes/switch/)

MAC addresses can also be used in various protocols for error detection and correction, ensuring data intergrity.
