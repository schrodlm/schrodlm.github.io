### What is Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)?

- LTL is a formalism that allows you to describe how a system evolves over time, where time is represented as a linear sequence of states.
- The term "linear" means that the states follow one another in a single sequence, like a timeline.
- LTL is used to express properties like "something will eventually happen" or "something will always hold."

In this logic, you can use **temporal operators** such as:

- `◯` (next): something happens in the next state.
- `◇` (eventually): something will happen at some point in the future.
- `□` (always): something is true in all future states.
- `U` (until): something holds until another condition becomes true.

The worlds (or states) form a total order, which means each world has exactly one "next" world, creating a linear structure. In this way, LTL describes a single-threaded, sequential progression of time.

You would use **LTL** when you're interested in the temporal properties of a system's execution (i.e., how things evolve over time in a linear fashion) and don't need to focus on the precise interleaving of concurrent actions. On the other hand, **interleaving models** are more suitable when you need to model and reason about the detailed interaction between multiple concurrent processes.

### Scenario: System with a Request-Response Behavior

Imagine a simple system where a **request** is made, and after some time, the system must provide a **response**. We want to verify certain temporal properties of this system using LTL.

#### Example Properties in LTL:

1. **Safety Property**: "A response is never made before a request."
    
    - This ensures that the system cannot respond unless a request has been made first.
    
    In LTL, we can express this as:
    
    $G (\text{response} \rightarrow \text{request})$
    
    - **G** (Globally): This means that this condition must hold **in every state** of the system.
    - **Meaning**: In every state, if the system produces a response, it must mean that a request has been made first. No response should occur without a request.
2. **Liveness Property**: "Every request is eventually followed by a response."
    
    - This ensures that whenever a request occurs, a response will eventually happen.
    
    In LTL, we can express this as:
    
    $G (\text{request} \rightarrow F (\text{response}))$
    
    - **G** (Globally): This holds in all states, meaning that for every request, the condition after it (eventually getting a response) must always be true.
    - **F** (Eventually): This means that at some point in the future, a response will occur.
    - **Meaning**: For every state in which a request occurs, there will eventually be a state in the future where a response happens.
3. **Next State Property**: "If a request is made, the response will happen in the next state."
    
    - This is a stricter property where the response must immediately follow the request.
    
    In LTL, we can express this as:
    
    $G (\text{request} \rightarrow X (\text{response}))$
    
    - **G** (Globally): This must be true for every state.
    - **X** (Next): This means that in the very next state after a request, a response must occur.
    - **Meaning**: If a request occurs at state sss, the very next state must include a response.### What is Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)?

### Explanation of LTL Operators Used:

- **$G$** (Globally): Ensures that a condition holds in all states, across the entire execution of the system.
- **$F$** (Eventually): Ensures that something will happen at least once at some point in the future.
- **$X$** (Next): Ensures that something will happen in the very next state.
- **$\rightarrow$** (Implication): Specifies that if the condition on the left is true, then the condition on the right must be true as well.

### Use Case:

These formulas are useful for verifying that the system behaves as expected:

- The **safety property** ensures that the system never behaves inappropriately (e.g., responding before a request).
- The **liveness property** ensures that the system will eventually fulfill its duties (e.g., always responding to requests).
- The **next state property** sets strict timing conditions for how quickly the system should respond.

LTL is commonly used in **[model checking](/notes/model-checking.html)** to verify that systems, particularly reactive systems like operating systems, network protocols, or hardware controllers, adhere to these kinds of properties.
