I attended FIT ČVUT for 4 years. During 2021-2025. I successfully finished my bachelor's here. It was a very pleasant although very taxing experience. I gained a lot, but it was at a price of a lot of stress and not a lot of time. I think it was worth it. Thanks to the work I put it, I am able to work on things I always wanted to and can spend time in a work that is actually interesting for me.
