I studied software engineering at Czech Technical University FIT for 4 years. After successfully finishing my bachelor's degree I decided to change universities for my master's degree and started attending Charles' University (Mathematical and Physical faculty - MFF).

This page contains my experiences from different course I've taken over the years and materials that I made for these courses.
