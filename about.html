  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    I’m developing cool things at <strong>Prusa Research</strong> with a bunch of other cool dudes. By cool things, I mean firmware for 3D printers, which is much more fun than it sounds—I swear!
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m also still successfully maintaining my status as a student at <strong>Czech Technical University</strong>, where I’m finishing my Bachelor’s degree. This is as fun as it sounds, which is, surprisingly, a lot!  I am not sure why I decided uni sounded fun, but I think I am rolling with it. </p>
  <p class="closing">
    I’m using this space as a way to gather my thoughts on different topics I come across or just to spread misinformation—you choose >:)
